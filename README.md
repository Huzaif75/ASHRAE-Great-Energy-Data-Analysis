# ASHRAE-Great-Energy-Data-Analysis
Performed a thorough data analysis in Python of a Kaggle challenge from ASHRAE that had information on the energy use of more than 1000 buildings in 2016. Meter readings are offered for several meter types, including chilled water, electric, hot water, and steam meters.
Computed the missing/Nan values and identified abnormal/outlier values using outlier detection technique (Box plot).
Python was utilized to do exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the matplotlib and seaborn libraries were employed for visualization purpose.
Essential data, patterns, and relationships between characteristics were extracted from the data.
